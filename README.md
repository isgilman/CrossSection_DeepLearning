# Cross Section Deep Learning
### Using deep learning to automatically detect and measure cells from leaf cross sections.

Perhaps the most striking features of (well-known) CAM plants is their unique morphology. Cacti, agaves, aloes, and "air plants" (_Tillandsia_ sp.) often have macroscopic innovations like large, succulent leaves or have lost leaves all together in favor of column-like forms. CAM plants also differ at the microscopic level; for example CAM plants usually have larger cells (for water and malic acid storage) and less space between their cells (to prevent the diffusion of CO2). The evolution of these micro- and macrostructures are integral components of the evolution of CAM photosynthesis. However, measuring microscopic features is time consuming and monotonous, which forces most researchers to only measure a few cells per cross-section image. Using deep learning techniques, this work will help automate the detection of cells in images and make measurements such as length, width, and area to increase the volume of usable data output from cross-section images.


## Notes and To do
- Cut images into sections
  - Aim for something around around 128x128
- Marking/annotating images
  - Get images with just stains
